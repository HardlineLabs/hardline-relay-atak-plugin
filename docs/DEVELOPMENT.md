# Development

Run commands from this repository in PowerShell 7. The workstation toolchain is
owned by the umbrella workspace's operations/relay-workstation.md and
tools/bootstrap-relay.ps1. Use that bootstrap on a replacement machine.

## Daily loop

```powershell
.\tools\check.ps1
.\tools\devices.ps1 list
.\tools\devices.ps1 install
.\tools\devices.ps1 test
```

Install/test defaults to exactly two authorized physical devices. More, fewer,
offline, or unauthorized devices fail before installation. To select one:
`./tools/devices.ps1 install --serial SERIAL --count 1`.
Explicitly select both phones with two `--serial` arguments if other devices
are connected. Emulator use additionally requires `--allow-emulator`.

Live tools use one terminal per phone and do not save logs:
`./tools/devices.ps1 logs --serial SERIAL --count 1` and
`./tools/devices.ps1 mirror --serial SERIAL --count 1`. Stop with Ctrl+C.
Logs show HardlineRelay and crash entries only. Never collect Meshtastic packet
payloads, channel URLs, QR images, or keys in routine diagnostics.

`./tools/start-emulator.ps1` starts Hardline_Relay_API34 after the hypervisor
is enabled and Windows has restarted. Then use `./tools/check.ps1 -Connected`.
The emulator tests Android UI/lifecycle; it does not emulate Bluetooth LoRa radios.
For the actual SDK-host plugin build and install, use ../atak-plugin/README.md.

## Build outputs

- app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
- app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
- core/build/reports/tests/test/index.html
- app/build/reports/lint-results-debug.html

Outputs are disposable and ignored. Build directories are regenerated; never
check in screenshots, logs, APKs, local.properties, debug keys, or session notes.
Use `./gradlew.bat clean` when removing stale build outputs.
Python tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_*.py'`.

## Fixed compatibility

The Gradle files and wrapper own compiler/dependency versions. Do not accept
Android Studio upgrade suggestions or run dependency-update bots. Gradle wrapper
checks its distribution SHA-256; dependency lockfiles and
gradle/verification-metadata.xml pin resolved dependencies and artifact hashes.

Intentional upgrades require a reviewed compatibility change, both protocol
snapshots compared, both repositories' checks, and two-phone integration.
Do not run --write-locks or --write-verification-metadata in routine builds.
Initial verification hashes are trust-on-first-use from the configured HTTPS
repositories, not an independent upstream signature audit.

## IDE

`./tools/open-studio.ps1` configures this repository and opens Android Studio.
Use its embedded JBR for the IDE and the pinned Microsoft JDK 17 for Gradle.
Product source lives here. Agent onboarding and workstation notes live in the
umbrella workspace, with links into these human-maintained documents.

## Git

Work from current origin/develop on feature/<name>. Validate and push coherent
commits, then merge through develop. main is reserved for an authorized release.
There is no publication workflow in this scaffold.
